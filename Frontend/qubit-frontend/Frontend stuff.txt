Text validation using math.parse. Math.parse takes any expression and makes it into a detailed tree, where each node represents a node type and the value. For example, it breaks up the expression (3 * 4) into a tree that looks something like: 3 (constant), * (expression), 4 (constant). Using math.parse allows me to include certain values while excluding others, all without having to write my own parsing logic.
